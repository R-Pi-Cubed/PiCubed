## PiCubed - A Paper Minecraft Java server install assistant for Raspberry Pi.

PiCubed will assist you in the installation of a Paper Minecraft Java Server. **It will NOT do everything for you**

*"Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime"*

PiCubed makes the assumption that you are tinkering with a Raspberry Pi because you are the type of person that, well likes to tinker and know a little more about what's going on under the hood. If you are ready to learn a little more and put in a little more effort then this script if for you. If not, thank you for looking. We'll still be here if you want to learn a little more later. In all reality though running a Minecraft server, even a small one for you and a couple of friends, will require you to learn a few things about the process.

## Log4j vulnerability

You may have heard in the news about a vulnerability in a piece of software called Log4j. There are countless pages of information on it found with a quick intenet search so I will only briefly address it here. This vulnerability was actually first discovered by the Minecraft community and the entire community has been quick to resolve the vulnerability. **The latest version of the Minecraft client from Mojang and the latest version of the Paper server have been patched to these vulnerabilities.** Indeed even older versions have been patched but it is best to verify on an idividual basis the status of the patch if you are not using the latest software.

## Before you get started

This script will assist you to install a Minecraft **Server** on a Raspberry Pi. It will **NOT** provide you with a Minecraft client to use to play on the server. If you have not yet done so you will need to purchase a copy of Minecraft. That copy you purchase is called the client. Also note that this server will only work for a PC version of Minecraft. This is referred to as Java Minecraft. Minecraft comes in 2 versions. The Java version is the original version and is typically thought of when talking about a PC version of Minecraft. Then there is the Bedrock version. Bedrock is the version of Minecraft that is on gaming consoles like the XBox and mobile devices like cell phones and tablets. These versions are not compatible and don't usually play well together. So the bad news is that if you are playing Minecraft on your Playstation this script won't work for you to create a server for you and your friends. At least not for now. Maybe in the future. The good news is though that as of March 2022 if you play Minecraft on the PC you automatically get both versions of Minecraft. You can find out mor about that on the official [Minecraft Website](https://www.minecraft.net)
